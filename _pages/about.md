Hii! Welcome to my personal website, I'm a Sophomore pursuing my B'Tech in Computer Science at IIT Gandhinagar.

I am a passionate individual with a deep fascination for the intersection of technology and various domains. My academic journey has been shaped by a diverse range of experiences, each one fueling my curiosity and driving me forward.

My fascination in NLP led me to collaborate with [Prof. Mayank Singh](https://mayank4490.github.io/) on theme "Open Models for Reproducible NLP Research." which led in the submission of our work to the prestigious ARR 2024 conference.

Beyond academics, I have actively contributed as a Flutter developer for the [Blithchron Cultural Festival](https://blithchron.iitgn.ac.in/). 

Looking ahead, I am particularly enthusiastic about the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their applications across various domains. I am eager to explore how these powerful models can be leveraged to drive innovation and solve complex challenges. Additionally, I am deeply interested in the intersection of machine learning and the medical field, where cutting-edge technologies can revolutionize healthcare practices and improve patient outcomes.

With a diverse skill set, a passion for continuous learning, and a commitment to excellence, I am excited to embark on new adventures and contribute to the ever-evolving landscape of technology. Feel free to explore my website further to learn more about my work and experiences.
